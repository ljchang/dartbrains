    "In this notebook we will begin to learn how to use Python.  There are many different ways to install Python, but we recommend starting using Anaconda which is preconfigured for scientific computing.  Start with installing [Python 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).  For those who prefer a more configurable IDE, [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is a nice option.  Python is a modular interpreted language with an intuitive minimal syntax that is quickly becoming one of the most popular languages for [conducting research](http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2013/11/18/the-homogenization-of-scientific-computing-or-why-python-is-steadily-eating-other-languages-lunch/).  You can use python for [stimulus presentation](http://www.psychopy.org/), [data analysis](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/), [machine-learning](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [scraping data](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), creating websites with [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) or [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), or [neuroimaging data analysis](http://nipy.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of free useful resources to learn how to use python and various modules.  See Yaroslav Halchenko's excellent [Dartmouth course](https://github.com/dartmouth-pbs/psyc161).  [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) is a great interactive tutorial.  [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is an incredibly useful resource for asking specific questions and seeing responses to others that have been rated by the development community. \n",

    "## Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "We will primarily be using [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) to interface with Python.  A Jupyter notebook consists of **cells**. The two main types of cells you will use are code cells and markdown cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **_code cell_** contains actual code that you want to run. You can specify a cell as a code cell using the pulldown menu in the toolbar in your Jupyter notebook. Otherwise, you can can hit esc and then y (denoted \"esc, y\") while a cell is selected to specify that it is a code cell. Note that you will have to hit enter after doing this to start editing it.\n",
    "If you want to execute the code in a code cell, hit \"shift + enter.\" Note that code cells are executed in the order you execute them. That is to say, the ordering of the cells for which you hit \"shift + enter\" is the order in which the code is executed. If you did not explicitly execute a cell early in the document, its results are now known to the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Markdown cells_** contain text. The text is written in markdown, a lightweight markup language. You can read about its syntax [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). Note that you can also insert HTML into markdown cells, and this will be rendered properly. As you are typing the contents of these cells, the results appear as text. Hitting \"shift + enter\" renders the text in the formatting you specify.  You can specify a cell as being a markdown cell in the Jupyter toolbar, or by hitting \"esc, m\" in the cell. Again, you have to hit enter after using the quick keys to bring the cell into edit mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, when you want to add a new cell, you can use the \"Insert\" pulldown menu from the Jupyter toolbar. The shortcut to insert a cell below is \"esc, b\" and to insert a cell above is \"esc, a.\" Alternatively, you can execute a cell and automatically add a new one below it by hitting \"alt + enter.\""
