## CLASS FORMAT

The format of Psych60 will be slightly different than the typical in-person version of the course. All course materials will be made available online in the format of a Jupyter book, https://dartbrains.org/. Lectures will primarily be delivered via publicly available pre-recorded lectures available on youtube. Each course module will have a Jupyter book tutorial and an accompanying assignment that will require completing some type of programming task or analysis. Students will work within small groups throughout the term on their assignments. Scheduled classes will primarily take the form of a Q&A where solutions to the assignments will be discussed and specific topics can be discussed in more detail. There will be a single exam, in which students will have to replicate an analysis of a published study using real data. For the final project, students will analyze an existing publicly available dataset to answer a new research question. Unfortunately, we will not be able to collect a new fMRI dataset as the Dartmouth Brain Imaging Center is closed to non-PBS users this term.

## ZOOM MEETINGS

All class meetings will be held on Zoom. By participating in the Zoom meetings, all students will consent to the following:

** (1) Consent to recording of course and group office hours**

- I affirm my understanding that this course and any associated group meetings involving students and the instructor, including but not limited to scheduled and ad hoc office hours and other consultations, may be recorded within any digital platform used to offer remote instruction for this course;
- I further affirm that the instructor owns the copyright to their instructional materials, of which these recordings constitute a part, and distribution of any of these recordings in whole or in part without prior written consent of the instructor may be subject to discipline by Dartmouth up to and including expulsion;
- I authorize Dartmouth and anyone acting on behalf of Dartmouth to record my participation and appearance in any medium, and to use my name, likeness, and voice in connection with such recording; and
- I authorize Dartmouth and anyone acting on behalf of Dartmouth to use, reproduce, or distribute such recording without restrictions or limitation for any educational purpose deemed appropriate by Dartmouth and anyone acting on behalf of Dartmouth.

** (2) Requirement of consent to one-on-one recordings**

- By enrolling in this course, I hereby affirm that I will not under any circumstance make a recording in any medium of any one-on-one meeting with the instructor without obtaining the prior written consent of all those participating, and I understand that if I violate this prohibition, I will be subject to discipline by Dartmouth up to and including expulsion, as well as any other civil or criminal penalties under applicable law.

## COMMUNICATION

For this class, we will have most of our discussion through the slack channel and the class [discourse page](https://www.askpbs.org/c/dartbrains/9).

## TEXTBOOK

The course website (https://dartbrains.org/) and embedded videos will serve as the textbook for this course. Students may find the optional book (Poldrack, R. A., Mumford, J. A., & Nichols, T. E. (2011). Handbook of functional MRI data analysis. Cambridge University Press) to be helpful.

## LECTURES

Lectures will primarily be delivered via freely available youtube videos. Students are expected to watch these on their own time and bring question to class or post on slack.

## READINGS

Readings will supplement the online lectures and will be made available via Canvas.

## CLASS PARTICIPATION (15% of grade)

You will be expected to participate in class discussions. This might include asking clarifying questions or helping another student. You will be expected to post at least one question each week on the DartBrains Discourse page https://www.askpbs.org/c/dartbrains/9 . Students can receive extra credit by helping answering their peers’ questions.

## HOMEWORK (30% of grade)

We will have homework assignments for each topic covered. Homework is due before class begins and will be accessed on the jupyterhub server by the instructor. Students will be allowed to work collaboratively on their homework with a small pod (3-4 students).

## METHODS FLASH TALK (5% of grade)

Each student will present a very brief presentation on a neuroimaging analysis method. Presentations should be developed on google slides and should be between 2-5 minutes. Presentations should include a high-level overview of the method, evidence for how it improves existing methods, and at least one potential application.

## EXAM (20% of grade)

To ensure that students learn key concepts about the principles of fMRI data analysis, we will have one exam that will involve analyzing a new dataset to demonstrate competence of analysis skills.

## ANALYSIS PROJECT (30% of grade)

A key component of this course is learning how to process and analyze imaging data. Students will be introduced to key concepts during the laboratory assignments. Students will be expected to apply what they learn to analyzing an fMRI dataset. Most students will likely analyze the data collected in class, but are free to analyze any publicly available dataset (e.g., https://openfmri.org/, https://www.datalad.org/datasets.html). Students may work in small groups (~2-3 people), but each will independently write a final report of the research. The final written paper should be in journal format using APA style with an abstract, intro, methods, results, discussion, and references. Format 12-20 typed double-space pages, 11pt Ariel or Times font. (bibliography not included in the page limit). Each person is expected to write their own intro and conclusion, but the group can collaborate on the methods and results sections if they want. At the end of the class each group will give a ~10 minute presentation on their project (background, hypothesis, experimental design, results, analyses, conclusions). Paper Due at Midnight on the last day of class.
• Paper: 15%
• Presentation: 10%
• Group participation: 5%

## CLASSROOM POLICIES

### HONOR CODE

Students are expected to strictly adhere to the Dartmouth Academic Honor Principle. As described in the Student Handbook, fundamental to the principle of independent learning is the requirement of honesty and integrity in the performance of academic assignments, both in the classroom and outside. Dartmouth operates on the principle of academic honor. Students who submit work that is not their own or who commit other acts of academic dishonesty will forfeit the opportunity to continue at Dartmouth. If you have questions or concerns regarding this policy during the course, please contact Professor Chang.

### PLAGIARISM

Writing about scientific publications without just rephrasing is difficult, particularly when not everything is fully understood. Doing this properly takes time and practice, and one goal of the course is to move us in that direction. I don’t expect to see a perfect scientific treatment at this stage. But I do want to see evidence of independent thought when considering the material and implications (rather than just regurgitating it), and some degree of creativity. When quoting, be sure appropriate citations are made.

### MISSED ASSIGNMENTS

A student will only be excused from an assignment by permission of the Instructor and on the basis of a written note from a dean, doctor, or supervisor of official college-sponsored events being held off-campus and requiring a students’ absence. If excused, a make-up must be taken as soon as possible (usually within 1 day of the originally-scheduled exam/assignment date).

### LATE ASSIGNMENTS

All papers and presentations are due at the date and time specified. Scores for late papers will be reduced by 10% for every 24-hour period a paper is late. No extensions will be granted due to computer failure, roommate difficulties, printing problems, etc. According to College policy, there are no excused absences from class for participation in College-sponsored extracurricular activities.

### DISABILITIES

Any student with a documented disability needing academic adjustments or accommodations is requested to speak with me by the end of the second week of the term. All discussions will remain confidential, although the Academic Skills Center may be consulted to verify the documentation of the disability.

### MENTAL HEALTH

The academic environment at Dartmouth is challenging, our terms are intensive, and classes are not the only demanding part of your life. There are a number of resources available to you on campus to support your wellness, including your [undergraduate dean](https://students.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate-deans/), [Counseling and Human Development](https://students.dartmouth.edu/health-service/counseling/about), and the [Student Wellness Center](https://students.dartmouth.edu/wellness-center/). I encourage you to use these resources to take care of yourself throughout the term, and email me if you experience any difficulties.

### RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES

Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you have a religious observance which conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with me by the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.

### TITLE IX

At Dartmouth, we value integrity, responsibility, and respect for the rights and interests of others, all central to our Principles of Community. We are dedicated to establishing and maintaining a safe and inclusive campus where all have equal access to the educational and employment opportunities Dartmouth offers. We strive to promote an environment of sexual respect, safety, and well-being. In its policies and standards, Dartmouth demonstrates unequivocally that sexual assault, gender-based harassment, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking are not tolerated in our community.

[The Sexual Respect Website](https://sexual-respect.dartmouth.edu) at Dartmouth provides a wealth of information on your rights with regard to sexual respect and resources that are available to all in our community.

Please note that, as a faculty member, I am obligated to share disclosures regarding conduct under Title IX with Dartmouth's Title IX Coordinator. Confidential resources are also available, and include licensed medical or counseling professionals (e.g., a licensed psychologist), staff members of organizations recognized as rape crisis centers under state law (such as WISE), and ordained clergy (see [https://dartgo.org/titleix_resources](https://dartgo.org/titleix_resources)).

Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact Dartmouth's Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator for the Guarini School. Their contact information can be found on the sexual respect website at: [https://sexual-respect.dartmouth.edu](https://sexual-respect.dartmouth.edu).
