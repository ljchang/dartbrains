# Measurement and Signal

Measuring in-vivo brain activity from humans is an extraordinary feat. How do scanners work? and what exactly are we measuring?

In this section, we will provide a very introductory overview of the basics of MR Physics and the physiology underlying the signal we are measuring with BOLD fMRI.

## Lecture

The lecture for this section can be viewed [here](../../images/lectures/Measurement_Signal.pdf).

## Readings

Please read Chapter 7 of the [Huettel, Song, & McCarthy textbook](http://sites.sinauer.com/fmri3e/sq07.html) on the BOLD signal

## Videos

There are many fantastic lectures on this topic. We recommend watching the short videos by Tor Wager and Martin Lindquist from their Principles of fMRI Coursera class.
