    "# Download Data\n",
    "\n",
    "*Written by Luke Chang*\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the imaging tutorials throughout this course will use open data from the Pinel Localizer task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pinel Localizer task was designed to probe several different types of basic cognitive processes, such as visual perception, finger tapping, language, and math. Several of the tasks are cued by reading text on the screen (i.e., visual modality) and also by hearing auditory instructions (i.e., auditory modality). The trials are randomized across conditions and have been optimized to maximize efficiency for a rapid event related design. There are 100 trials in total over a 5-minute scanning session. Read the original [paper](https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2202-8-91) for more specific details about the task and the [dataset paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.09.052). \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is well suited for these tutorials as it is (a) publicly available to anyone in the world, (b) relatively small (only about 5min), and (c) provides many options to create different types of contrasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a total of 94 subjects available, but we will primarily only be working with a smaller subset of about 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the data is being shared on the [OSF website](https://osf.io/vhtf6/files/), we recommend downloading it from our [g-node repository](https://gin.g-node.org/ljchang/Localizer) as we have fixed a few issues with BIDS formatting and have also performed preprocessing using fmriprep.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will walk through how to access the datset using DataLad. Note, that the entire dataset is fairly large (~42gb), but the tutorials will mostly only be working with a small portion of the data (5.8gb), so there is no need to download the entire thing. If you are taking the Psych60 course at Dartmouth, we have already made the data available on the jupyterhub server.\n"

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "## DataLad\n",
    "\n",
    "The easist way to access the data is using [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org/), which is an open source version control system for data built on top of [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/). Think of it like git for data. It provides a handy command line interface for downloading data, tracking changes, and sharing it with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "While DataLad offers a number of useful features for working with datasets, there are three in particular that we think make it worth the effort to install for this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Cloning a DataLad Repository can be completed with a single line of code `datalad clone <repository>` and provides the full directory structure in the form of symbolic links. This allows you to explore all of the files in the dataset, without having to download the entire dataset at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Specific files can be easily downloaded using `datalad get <filename>`, and files can be removed from your computer at any time using `datalad drop <filename>`. As these datasets are large, this will allow you to only work with the data that you need for a specific tutorial and you can drop the rest when you are done with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) All of the DataLad commands can be run within Python using the datalad [python api](http://docs.datalad.org/en/latest/modref.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will only be covering a few basic DataLad functions to get and drop data. We encourage the interested reader to read the very comprehensive DataLad [User Handbook](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/) for more details and troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Datalad\n",
    "\n",
    "DataLad can be easily installed using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install datalad`\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, it currently requires manually installing the [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/) dependency, which is not automatically installed using pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using OSX, we recommend installing git-annex using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "`brew install git-annex`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are on Debian/Ubuntu we recommend enabling the [NeuroDebian](http://neuro.debian.net/) repository and installing with apt-get.\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo apt-get install datalad`\n",
    "\n",
    "For more installation options, we recommend reading the DataLad [installation instructions](https://git-annex.branchable.com/).\n"

The developer's have made a number of choices about how to preprocess your fMRI data using best practices and have created an automated pipeline using multiple software packages that are all distributed via a [docker container](https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docker.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Though, you are welcome to just start working right away with the preprocessed data, here are the steps to run it yourself:\n",
    "\n",
    " - 1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and download image\n",
    "     \n",
    "     `docker pull poldracklab/fmriprep:<latest-version>`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - 2. Run a single command in the terminal specifying the location of the data, the location of the output, the participant id, and a few specific flags depending on specific details of how you want to run the preprocessing.\n",

    "    \n",
    "In practice, it's alway a little bit finicky to get everything set up on a particular system. Sometimes you might run into issues with a specific missing file like the [freesurfer license](https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#the-freesurfer-license) even if you're not using it. You might also run into issues with the format of the data that might have some conflicts with the [bids-validator](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator). In our experience, there is always some frustrations getting this to work, but it's very nice once it's done."
