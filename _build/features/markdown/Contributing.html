<p>One of the wonderful aspects of both the neuroimaging and Python scientific computing communities is the strong commitment to developing and sharing knowledge and tools within the broader community. The goal of the dartbrains project is to build on this work and provide a resource for people to learn about how to analyze neuroimaging data. We try to incorporate as much open content as we can find that contributes to this goal. Please let us know if we have inadvertently omitted credit for any content generated by others. Though this project is based on a neuroimaging analysis course taught at Dartmouth College, we welcome contributions from anyone in the broader imaging community.</p>
